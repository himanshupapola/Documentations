# 10. AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)

The **AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)** is a **whitepaper** (not a service) that helps organizations **build and execute a comprehensive plan** for their **digital transformation** using AWS.

It provides **best practices**, **guidance**, and **structured perspectives** to help you **leverage cloud technology effectively**.

## Components of AWS CAF

AWS CAF consists of **two key components**:

1. **Organizational Capabilities** – These represent the foundational abilities an organization must develop to successfully transform its platforms, processes, and operations using the cloud. They act as the support system enabling transformation.

2. **Six Perspectives** – AWS CAF groups its capablities into six preerpsectives.

### The Six Perspectives
