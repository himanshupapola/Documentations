# 🧵 05. Amazon MQ

**Amazon MQ** is a **managed message broker service** for **Apache ActiveMQ** (and **RabbitMQ**).  
It provides **open-standard protocols** for messaging — ideal when migrating traditional applications to AWS.

---

### 🧩 Concept Overview

While **SQS** and **SNS** are **cloud-native**, fully managed AWS messaging services,  
some legacy or enterprise systems use **open messaging protocols** such as:

- **MQTT**  
- **AMQP**  
- **STOMP**  
- **OpenWire**  
- **WSS**

Instead of rewriting these applications to use AWS-specific APIs (SQS/SNS),  
you can migrate them to AWS using **Amazon MQ** with minimal code change.

### ⚙️ How It Works

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Broker** | Managed Apache ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ instance running inside AWS. |
| **Producers & Consumers** | Use standard protocols (AMQP, MQTT, etc.) to send and receive messages. |
| **Queues & Topics** | Supports both models — **queues** (like SQS) and **topics** (like SNS). |

✅ Great for **lift-and-shift** migrations.  
✅ No need to refactor existing apps that already use messaging.  
❌ Not serverless — runs on a **dedicated EC2-like broker** instance.
