# 06. 🛡️ SRM for IAM

---
## ☁️ AWS Responsibilities

AWS is responsible for protecting the **infrastructure** that runs all AWS services:

- Global network and data center security
- Configuration and vulnerability analysis
- Compliance validation

---

## 👩‍💻 Your Responsibilities

You are responsible for securely managing **IAM within your AWS account**, including:

- Users, Groups, Roles, and Policies management and monitoring
- Enabling **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** on all accounts
- Regularly rotating **access keys**
- Using IAM tools to apply **least privilege permissions**
- Analyzing access patterns and **reviewing permissions** periodically

> 🧠 **Tip:** Always follow the _Principle of Least Privilege_ — give users and roles only the permissions they truly need.
